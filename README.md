# Numerical Algorithms

This is a repository that contains several algorithms of approximation, including root finding, integration, differential equations and interpolation

The methods can be found within the `functions` folder, where you will encounter different directories

- `bvp` : For second order linear boundary value problems. You can use the linear shooting, and finite differences methods.
- `diff` : Initial value problems. You can find the `scalar` and `vector` directories, to solve for first order and high order differential equations respectively, using single step methods such as Euler, modified Euler, Heun and Runge-Kutta 4.
- `spline`: You can solve for cubic spline interpolation. More specifically, you can create natural, extrapolated, clamped, parabolic and known curvature splines.
